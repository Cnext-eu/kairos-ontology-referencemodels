# Changelog

All notable changes to the Kairos Reference Models will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.8.0] - 2026-06-20

### Changed
- **BSP v1.5.0 — relocate the party→address relationship.** The
  `:hasAddress` / `:hasBillingAddress` / `:hasShippingAddress` object properties
  moved from the `reference-data` module into the `party` module, where their
  `rdfs:domain` (`:TradeParty`) lives. `party` now `owl:imports` `reference-data`
  for the `Address` range. This makes the party module self-contained for address
  navigation — any consumer importing `bsp/party#` gets the relationship without
  separately importing reference-data. The `Address` class stays in
  `reference-data` as shared master data; the unused `party:` prefix was removed
  from `reference-data`.
  - Property IRIs changed from `…/bsp/reference-data#hasAddress…` to
    `…/bsp/party#hasAddress…`. These properties were introduced in BSP 1.4.0 with
    no downstream consumers, so impact is minimal.
  - BSP 1.4.0 snapshot archived under `BSP/archive/1.4.0/`.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- **Explicit relationships across logistics reference models** — generic parent
  object properties that make implicit party/location links navigable (the same
  pattern as BSP `party` → `:hasAddress`). Typed roles are retained as
  `rdfs:subPropertyOf` the new generics:
  - **MMT v1.1.0** (`consignment`): `:hasParty` (→ `mmt-party:TransportParty`)
    over consignor/consignee/carrier/freight-forwarder/notify-party; `:hasLocation`
    (→ `mmt-loc:TransportLocation`) over departure/arrival.
  - **DCSA v1.2.0** (`booking`): `:hasParty` (→ `party:ShippingParty`) over
    shipper/consignee/carrier/booking-party/notify-party; `:hasLocation`
    (→ `loc:Location`) over place-of-receipt/port-of-loading/port-of-discharge/
    place-of-delivery/transshipment. (`transport-documents`):
    `:hasDocumentParty` and `:hasDocumentLocation` over the document-level roles.
  - **TIC v1.3.0** (`events`): `:atChargingStation` (→ `tic-infra:ChargingStation`)
    and `:chargedEquipment` (→ `tic-infra:TerminalEquipment`) make the charging
    session's `:chargingStationRef` / `:vehicleRef` identifiers navigable.
    (`party`): `:stevedoresCarrierVisit` (→ `tic-ops:CarrierVisit`) links a
    stevedore to the carrier visits it services.

### Changed
- Logistics accelerator bundle bumped to **1.4.0** to signal the refreshed
  constituent models (BSP 1.4.0, MMT 1.1.0, DCSA 1.2.0, TIC 1.3.0). Imports
  remain version-less ontology IRIs, so the bundle always composes each model's
  `current/` version.

### Removed
- Logistics client-hub-blueprint `examples/extensions/` starter templates
  (9 `*-silver-ext.ttl` + README). Silver extensions are authored per hub via the
  `kairos-design-silver` skill; the static examples were illustrative-only,
  unvalidated, and prone to drift.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- **BSP v1.4.0 — party master-data** (#17, #13):
  - `reference-data`: generic `:hasAddress` (1:n) with `:hasBillingAddress` /
    `:hasShippingAddress` now declared as `rdfs:subPropertyOf :hasAddress`
    (typed roles 0..1, documented cardinality).
  - `party`: new `:Contact` person entity (`rdfs:seeAlso` UN/CEFACT
    `TradeContact`) with `:hasContact` (1:n) and `:contactName` / `:jobTitle` /
    `:contactRole`; `:contactEmail` / `:contactPhone` broadened to cover both
    `TradeParty` and `Contact` (single canonical coordinate).
  - `financial`: new `:BankAccount` entity (1:n via `:hasBankAccount`) with
    `:iban` / `:bic` / `:accountNumber` / `:accountHolderName`; party-level
    `:hasPartyPaymentTerms`; currency-scoped `:creditLimit` +
    `:creditLimitCurrency`. FIBO used as design inspiration only (not imported).
- Logistics accelerator blueprint: surfaced contact persons, address, and
  bank account / credit limit in the party-commercial domain `provides` lists.

### Changed
- BSP reference model bumped to **1.4.0** (all modules) for the additions above.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- **Open-source governance** — repository is now released under the **Apache
  License 2.0** as part of the Kairos Community Edition:
  - `LICENSE` (Apache 2.0), `NOTICE`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` (DCO workflow),
    `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant v2.1), `SECURITY.md`
  - `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and issue templates (bug / feature)
  - `.gitignore` (Python, venv, build artifacts, OS/editor noise)
- **IMO v1.1.0** — 6 new modules: certificates-surveys, crew-seafarer,
  environmental, maritime-security, plus enriched party and locations (#11)
- **TIC v1.2.0** — new KPI and reefer-monitoring modules; enriched party,
  locations, events, automotive-services, handling-operations (#11)
- **DCSA v1.1.0** — new shared-kernel transport-call module; cross-domain
  `rdfs:seeAlso` annotations and declaration headers (#11)
- **WCO v1.2.0** — GoodsItem, Packaging, CustomsProcedure, Consignee/Consignor
  and 50+ new properties (#11)
- **SupplyChain v1.1.0** — 6 new bridge properties (sustainability, WCO goods,
  documents); added to the XML catalog
- Logistics accelerator v1.3.0 — refreshed metadata (WCO 3.0 → 3.10.0),
  blueprint imports and cross-domain bridge table

### Changed
- Relocated 9 `*-silver-ext.ttl` files from the derived ontologies to
  `accelerator-packs/logistics/client-hub-blueprint/examples/extensions/` as
  client starter templates — reference models now hold pure domain semantics
  only (#12)
- README: license badge MIT → Apache 2.0, version badge → 1.5.0, added Kairos
  Community Edition attribution and rewrote the License section
- Updated `ontology-reference-models/catalog-v001.xml` for the new modules

### Removed
- Stale `.github/info/.sparse-checkout` template (referenced directories that no
  longer exist and was never wired into git)
- Untracked an accidentally committed `scripts/__pycache__/*.pyc` artifact

## [1.4.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- Version bump release establishing the 1.4.x line (see git history for the
  detailed ontology changes folded into 1.5.0).

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-19

### Added
- Silver-layer extension files for all BSP derived ontology modules (`derived-ontologies/BSP/current/extensions/`):
  - `party-silver-ext.ttl` — TradeParty hierarchy with discriminator strategy
  - `commercial-silver-ext.ttl` — CommercialTransaction, Product, Shipment, BusinessEvent hierarchies + detail tables
  - `compliance-silver-ext.ttl` — RegulatoryRequirement, TariffClassification (ref), DutyTax, TradeAgreement, CustomsEvent
  - `documents-silver-ext.ttl` — Document hierarchy with 14 subtypes + DocumentEvent
  - `financial-silver-ext.ttl` — Invoice hierarchy, PaymentTerms (ref), Payment, InvoiceLine
  - `reference-data-silver-ext.ttl` — Location hierarchy (ref) + Measurement hierarchy
- All extensions use `kairos-ext:` annotation vocabulary with explicit annotations on every class

### Changed
- Bumped BSP ontology version from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- Corrected `scripts/test_catalog.py` catalog path to `ontology-reference-models/catalog-v001.xml` (was incorrectly pointing to repo root)
- Removed redundant `ontology-reference-models/` prefix from all relative URI paths in `ontology-reference-models/catalog-v001.xml` so paths resolve correctly from the catalog's own directory (OASIS XML Catalog spec)
- Moved canonical catalog location to `ontology-reference-models/catalog-v001.xml`; removed stale copy from repo root

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Updated FIBO ontologies from Q3 2025 (master_2025Q3) to Q4 2025 (master_2025Q4)

- Updated all catalog paths to point to correct FIBO version (edmcouncil-fibo-90770ba)
- Fixed download_fibo.py script to use correct target directory
- Fixed test_catalog.py script to use correct catalog path

### Added
- Backward-compatibility redirect for deprecated `FND/Parties/Roles/` → `FND/Parties/Parties/` in catalog

### Removed
- Removed non-existent `FND/Organizations/Organizations.rdf` mapping (module no longer exists in Q4 2025 FIBO)

### Fixed
- Unicode encoding issues in download_fibo.py for Windows console compatibility
- All 22 catalog mappings now validated and working correctly
